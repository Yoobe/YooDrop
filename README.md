# YooDrop

YooDrop — the digital twin of the global water cycle and an educational platform to raise water-awareness worldwide.

YooDrop brings the journey of a water droplet to life with interactive simulations, data-driven visualizations, and gamified learning. Our mission is to make water science accessible, engaging, and actionable for students, educators, policy makers, and the general public.

Why YooDrop?
- Teach complex hydrological concepts with intuitive visualizations and simulations.
- Connect real-time data, educational content, and storytelling to inspire stewardship.
- Reach classrooms and communities globally through multilingual content and modular learning paths.

What you'll find here
- A digital twin of the global water cycle: explore how water moves between oceans, rivers, clouds, groundwater, and ecosystems.
- Interactive modules and simulations that explain evaporation, precipitation, runoff, pollution transport, and water quality.
- Gamified experiences (e.g., Elemental Keepers) and the Elemental Academy learning pathways that make learning hands-on and memorable.
- Data integrations and visual layers that illustrate local-to-global water issues using real-world datasets.
- Resources for teachers: lesson plans, classroom activities, and hands-on exercises tied to curriculum outcomes.
- Community and outreach tools for educators, NGOs, and scientists to collaborate and share materials.

Core features
- Immersive, map-based visualizations of water pathways
- Scenario simulations highlighting pollution, conservation, and climate effects
- Guided learning modules and quizzes for different age groups
- Game-based learning to motivate exploration and retention
- Multilingual content and accessible UX for global reach
- APIs and data connectors for researchers and partners (examples and docs)

Why contribute?
- Make environmental education more engaging and impactful.
- Work on meaningful, real-world problems combining education, data visualization, game design, and geospatial tech.
- Contribute in many ways: front-end UI, simulations, data engineering, curriculum design, translations, UX/design, outreach, or documentation.
- Get credited in the project and become part of a community focused on social impact.

How to get involved (non-technical)
- Explore the site and play with the public demos to see what areas inspire you.
- Report bugs, request features, or suggest lesson ideas via Issues.
- Help translate content into other languages.
- Share the project with your network — teachers, environmental groups, and local schools love hands-on resources.

Developer quickstart (generic)
- Fork the repo and clone your fork.
- Check README or docs for repo-specific prerequisites (e.g., Node, Python, Docker).
- Look for an issue labeled good first issue or help wanted to get started.
- Run the local dev server per project docs and open a PR with your changes.
(If you want, we’ll tailor these steps to the repository's actual tech stack — tell us which stack the repo uses.)

Contributing guidelines
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests and include steps to reproduce or clear acceptance criteria.
- Pick an issue, leave a comment to indicate you're working on it, and link a PR when ready.
- Follow the repository's branch/commit naming conventions and include tests where applicable.
- Add or update documentation and provide screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- Be kind, constructive, and inclusive — follow our Code of Conduct.

Community & governance
- We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels.
- Maintainable contributions are reviewed by project maintainers; expect constructive feedback and opportunity to iterate.
- Contributors are recognized in the CONTRIBUTORS file and release notes.

Roadmap (high-level)
- Expand simulation fidelity and data sources for regional accuracy
- Develop more lesson plans and classroom-ready modules
- Launch Elemental Keepers game and expand curriculum tie-ins
- Improve mobile responsiveness and offline-friendly content
- Build partner integrations with schools, NGOs, and research groups
